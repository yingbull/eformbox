The decision of whether or not to pursue PSA screening should be based on shared decision-making after the potential benefits and harms associated with screening have been discussed.</strong></li>

		  For men electing to undergo PSA screening, we suggest that the intervals between testing should be individualized based on previous PSA levels:
		  <ul>
			<li>a. For men with PSA &lt;1 ng/ml, repeat PSA testing every four years</li>
			<li>b. For men with PSA 1–3 ng/ml, repeat PSA testing every two years</li>
			<li>c. For men with PSA >3 ng/ml, consider more frequent PSA testing intervals or adjunctive testing strategies</li>
